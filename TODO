- Have ability to override default parameter values.
   Search order for configuration values:
    - command line
    - network configuration file
    - dotfile
    - defaults

- Get smarter about naming and numbering nodes if their number changes

- Get smarter about when we need to kill the network and when we need to
  restart nodes

- Avoid regenerating so many authority keys: it's okay to recycle for
  testing.

- Right now we assume that we're acting like a fooctl startup/shutdown script
  series.  Instead we could run in a managed mode.

- Pipe stdout to a file, not to nowhere with "quiet"

- Log stuff.

- Split TorNode into a class that *just* holds the nodes configuration, and
  implements some methods that create other classes for the stuff we really
  need (node configurer, rc.d-like launcher, etc)

- Have launcher check for configuration

- Resolve XXXX comments

- Document everything

- Start writing passive "tests" like "did it bootstrap?" or "any
  warnings in the logs?", etc
